# My Personal Site
This is my personal portfolio site.

**Link to personal site:** [https://www.deesclouds.world]

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Started thinking about the intention my design before I started building out the content for my personal site with HTML. My focus was to improve SEO, Accessibility and Performance. At this time of writing this my site has a load time of 1.90s, DOMContentLoaded 1.40s and Finish time of 2.04s. 

## Optimizations
I removed spin from the image to improve the accessibility of the web app from 94 to 100.
Added a resume button to navigate to resume page. 

## Lessons Learned:

Doesn't matter if you have to start over sometimes. As long as you are happy with the results enough that you are proud enough to display them with your name attached. Nothing is ever complete everything is always a work in progress.

I had difficulty with the CSS animations rendering and a good resource [autoprefixer.github.io] was mentioned to use for help parsing through the CSS and adding vendor prefixes. 

There is a web application called Polypane that makes it easier to see how sites render on various display sizes.

Found out about formsubmit.co from youtuber Code with Ania Kub√≥w. 

## Thank you!
 
I want to say thank you to @ladybugsxoxo, @pcabezal, @hondurancoder @joah @Jimbo C. for helping me in ways and just with our interaction helped me to unlock a part of my brain and figure some things out.

Big thank you to @meliboi_ for steering my away from using a carousel for this site.

A huge, huge thank you to @abitsalihu for being a rockstar. @abitsalihu added some JavaScript functionality for the links to send vistors to certain sections on the site, improved the UI with smooth scroll, fixed the resume button by also adding a hover animation when clicked. The code they contributed helped me to understand how to tackle the issues I was facing and overall helped this site provide a much more magical experience for future visitors.
