## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML

Started building out the content of my personal site with HTML.

## Optimizations
None

## Lessons Learned:

Doesn't matter if you have to start over sometimes. As long as you are happy with the results enough that you are proud enough to display them with your name attached. Nothing is ever complete everything is always a work in progress.

I had difficulty with the CSS animations rendering and a good resource [autoprefixer.github.io] was mentioned to use for help parsing through the CSS and adding vendor prefixes.
