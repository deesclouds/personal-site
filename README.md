This is my personal portfolio site.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Started building out the content of my personal site with HTML.

## Optimizations
I removed spin from the image to improve the accessibility of the web app from 94 to 100.

## Lessons Learned:

Doesn't matter if you have to start over sometimes. As long as you are happy with the results enough that you are proud enough to display them with your name attached. Nothing is ever complete everything is always a work in progress.

I had difficulty with the CSS animations rendering and a good resource [autoprefixer.github.io] was mentioned to use for help parsing through the CSS and adding vendor prefixes. 

## Thank you!
I want to say thank you to @ladybugsxoxo, @pcabezal, @hondurancoder @joah @Jimbo C. for helping me in ways and just with our interaction helped me to open a part of my brain and figure some things out. Big thank you to @meliboi_ for steering my away from using a carousel for this site.
