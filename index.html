    <!-- About Container -->
    <h3 id="#about">About</h3>
    <p>I majored in Fine Arts and Art History during my time at the Fashion Institute of Technology. I started working as an art assistant for local artists in New York City shortly after finishing at FIT. After that, I transferred to Pace University to pursue photography with a double minor in non-profit studies and queer studies. Following my time at Pace, I worked as an intern for local photographers before presenting my work at the International Center of Photography, where I eventually worked as a teaching assistant for aspiring photographers.</p>

    <p>The pandemic hit during my time as a teaching assistant, forcing the school to close. I traveled to Long Beach, California, to pursue a career in programming and fell in love with the ability to express my passion for art while still learning about software and marketing. I wanted to be able to share my ideas with the rest of the world, so I studied software engineering and worked to create online experiences comparable to those at ICP. While museum exhibitions are now available online, I thought about how I might make my abilities more accessible. I've spent the last year honing my software engineering and digital marketing abilities in order to use code to create beautiful experiences for the general public.</p>
